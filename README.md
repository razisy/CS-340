# CS 340 Portfolio Reflection

## 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
For these projects, I focused on separating **data logic from application logic**, particularly with the CRUD Python module. By writing reusable and well-commented functions for connecting to MongoDB, the code became easier to maintain and scale. This modular design made it simple to integrate the CRUD module with the interactive dashboard in Project Two.
I can reuse this same CRUD module in future projects that require similar database operations, reducing development time and improving consistency.

## 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My approach involves **breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable components**. For example, with the dashboard project, I began by understanding Grazioso Salvareâ€™s requirements for filtering and visualizing rescue dog data. Then I structured the database, implemented CRUD operations, and finally integrated these with dashboard UI components.
This was different from earlier assignments where I focused on single components (like backend logic only). Here, I had to think **system-wide**, ensuring that the database, logic, and UI worked together smoothly.

## 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create systems that solve real problems efficiently. These projects show how data can be leveraged to support **mission-driven work**. For Grazioso Salvare, this dashboard helps identify dogs best suited for rescue training, improving decision-making and operational efficiency.
This kind of impact illustrates how technology can enable organizations to **do their work better, faster, and smarter.**
